# Bed occupancy sensor
HX711 Load cell connected to NodeMCU (esp8266) and with integrated WiFi and MQTT.



### Attention: 
!!! THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS !!!



# Used Hardware

### HX711 Load Cell
I bought mine at Ali Express. That was a set consisting of four load cells and one hx711 chip. You can use the hx711 with one, two, three or four load cells. Each set was about 6â‚¬ incl. shipping cost from china.

Because I wanted to build a bed sensor, I used four load cells and one hx711 which comes to a total load of 200kg (4x 50kg). And that for both sides of the bed.


### NodeMCU (ESP8266) 
Is used the nodeMCU with an ESP8266 chip and the wired hx711 chip. 

The first version here will only address one sensor and will then be expanded so that two mattresses can be monitored. Because in most beds lie two people ;)
